# swiftDialog Multi Dialog Demo

One of the more common requests for swiftDialog is the ability to have multiple screens or steps in the one process

With swiftDialog 2.3 there are some provisions for ensuring you can run multiple dialogs over the top of each other including over a `--blurscreen`

The multi-dialog demo script is meant to serve as a demonstration of a possible workflow that acheives this by calling multiple dialog instances over the top of a background dialog. The background dialog consists of a `--blurscreen` element and a dialog window with all visual elements remove except for a progress bar and progress text
