# swiftDialog-scripts
This repo contains a selection of short scripts that utilise [swiftDialog](https://github.com/bartreardon/swiftDialog) for various tasks as a means of demonstrating a particular feature.

Most of these will be of **demo quality** and are not intended to be used directly in a production setting. By all means though, feel free to use and expand on the ideas presented here.

## What is swiftDialog?

swiftDialog is an [open source](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog/blob/main/LICENSE.md) admin utility app for macOS 11+ written in SwiftUI that displays a popup dialog, displaying the content to your users that you want to display.

swiftDialog's purpose is as a tool for Mac Admins to show informative messages via scripts, and relay back the users actions.

The latest version can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/bartreardon/Dialog/releases) page
